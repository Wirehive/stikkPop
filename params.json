Download the latest build from the link above.\r\n1. Extract the zip.\r\n1. Run setup.exe from the /install/ directory.\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\nWhen the program first opens it will ask you to enter the address for your Stikked installation. Enter this in the box, and wait for the green tick to confirm the API is reachable.\r\n\r\nYou can enter your name and a default syntax for syntax highlighting.\r\n\r\nPasting privately means your paste will not appear in the listings within Stikked, eg recent or trending pastes.\r\n\r\nAuto copy will swap the contents of your clipboard for a link to the paste on Stikked.\r\n\r\nAuto open will open any new paste in your default browser.\r\n\r\n### How to use\r\nWith content in your clipboard simply hit Ctrl+v, or click the Paste Clipboard\" button, and you'll be given a URL in exchange.\r\n\r\nEntering a title is optional.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to build up a large paste you can do so with the built in editor: hit the \"Compose Paste\" button on the main window to get a notepad-like screen where you can work. Hit Submit in here to be given a URL like normal.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis was originally created as a weekend project by @SimonJGreen for internal use at Wirehive.
